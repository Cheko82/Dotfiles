## Lush

</p>

Based on: **Everforest**<br>
A foggy valley wallpaper provided as `valley.png`<br>
I used a rofi Everforest theme from ![here](https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection)<br>
To use the theme just add the file to `/usr/share/rofi/themes` and apply it using Rofi theme selector.<br>
I have set `shadow = false;` in `/etc/xdg/picom.conf`<br>
I'm using i3wm but my Polybar uses xworkspaces for workspaces module, reason being that it is clickable, scrollable and i don't care about workspace icons.
