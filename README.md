## Lush

[Lush SS]([https://github.com/Mr-Ocelot/Dotfiles/Lush/image.png](https://github.com/Mr-Ocelot/Dotfiles/blob/main/Lush/image.png))

Based on: **Everforest**<br>
A foggy valley wallpaper provided as `valley.png`<br>
I used a rofi Everforest theme from ![here](https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection)<br>
To use the theme just add the file to `/usr/share/rofi/themes` and apply it using Rofi theme selector.
